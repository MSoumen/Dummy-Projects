<ul>
  <li>Move your mouse cursor in the Window, the Logo will open like a box</li>
  <li>Remove your mouse from the Window, the Logo will close</li>
  <li> Pressing(holding) your mouse button inside the window will stop the animation</li>
  <li> Releasing mouse button will continue animate Window</li>
 </ul>
 
 Created this using `javax.swing`, `java.awt`, `java.awt.event` packages, and made the animation working by using MouseListener and ActionListener class.
