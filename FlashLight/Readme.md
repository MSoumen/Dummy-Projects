<ul><li>Just download the JAR file and run it</li>
    <li>Make sure you have installed the "Java" software</li>
    <li>I've not given any close button to close it, So close it from Task Manager or using `Alt+F4`</li>
</ul>
<b><i>If JAR file is not running in your machine then just download the Classes stored in `src/flashlight` package.
