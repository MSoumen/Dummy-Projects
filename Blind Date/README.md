Blind Date is a CLI program to find girlfriend/boyfriend for blind date.
The fun part is that it generate the result in an animated way.
1. Download the whole git then,
2. Run the program as `java FindMatch <Your Name> <gender(M/F)>`
3. Before running the program, make sure to update `boys.txt` and `girls.txt` for best suit to your friendzone.<br>

P.S :: Those names in the screenshot are totally fictitious and match generated randomly so, if there is any relation with this in reality then it is totally unintentional and I'm sorry for that.
